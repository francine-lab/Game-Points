# Game Points Project

The job was to remove the static HTML and create an object for each player with JavaScript; display this object on the screen with every new victory or tie point being calculated.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Click on buttons to update victories, defeats, and ties.
    - See the table with all their points on the screen

## Extra task

- I implemented a function that catches new players, and a function that sets the initial points for each player, and displays it in a table on the screen. The users can click on a button for each victory, and it will automatically update the total points on the table. The points from ties are automatically set for all players at the same time :D

## To do

- Include an image in each player's line.
- Include the defeat account automatically with the victories.
- Improve style.
