# Game Points Project

The job was to remove the static HTML and create an object for each player with JavaScript; display this object on the screen with every new victory or tie point being calculated.

## Tasks performed to achieve this project

- The users are able to:
    - Click on buttons to update victories, defeats, and ties.
    - See the table with all their points on the screen

## Extra task

- I implemented a function that catches new players and a function that sets the initial values for each player including a random mascot, and displays it in a table on the screen. 
- The users can click on a button for each victory, and it will automatically update the total points on the table. 
- The points from ties are automatically set for all players at the same time.
- The mascot can be randomly changed according to the player's wishes :D

## To do

- Include the defeat account automatically with the victories.
- Use only one button for the tie.
- Add valid input for player name (not empty).
- Add button to remove a player.
- Add button to edit a player.
- Add button to reset game scores.
